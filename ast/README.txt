Project #3

For this project, I ran into a lot of segmentation faults, but I fixed them all! I had to modify my grammar from prject #2  quite a bit in order to build the abstract syntax tree. For example since for an array: name[exp] could go to both an array asignment or arrayexpression I had to modify the grammar so that it returned 3 or 2 expression parameters depending on what i was trying to create. Overall all the test cases passed for the project. The hardest part was just understanding the classes.
