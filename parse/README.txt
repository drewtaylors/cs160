For this project, I first created the lexer using all tokens. The hardest part was getting the comments correct scanned.
For the parser, I fixed it so I did not have any shift reduce errors. I used the test cases in test.simple to test my grammer, and it passes all the cases in that file.

I dont think I ran into any major errors, unless I carelessly missed something.
